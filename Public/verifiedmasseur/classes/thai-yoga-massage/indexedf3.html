SUMMARY:Thai Yoga Massage
DESCRIPTION:Our Thai Yoga Massage blends a series of assisted yoga postures and guided stretching with gentle rocking and rhythmic acupressure to relieve joint and muscle tension. \nThis treatment is performed on the comfort of an Asian mat and loose clothing is suggested\, as the treatment is performed fully-clothed. \nUsing custom-blended Oriental oils and movements inspired by traditional Oriental therapies\, this tension-releasing massage treats the whole body. Oriental Essence focuses on the traditional stressholding areas of the back\, neck and shoulders. \nThe treatment begins with a compressive sequence to stimulate and balance the left and right hemispheres of the brain\, followed by a focused massage of the spine\, shoulders\, neck and face.The treatment begins with a compressive sequence to stimulate and balance the left and right hemispheres of the brain\, followed by a focused massage of the spine\, shoulders\, neck and face.The treatment begins with a compressive sequence to stimulate and balance the left and right hemispheres of the brain\, followed by a focused massage of the spine\, shoulders\, neck and face.
