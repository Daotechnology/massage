But the Inkaterra approach is as far from backpacker-grunge as it gets. Its three hotels are for those seeking both adventure and creature comforts, and are now all strung together on a new Walking to Wellness tour, which spans the Amazon, Machu Picchu and Cusco for 16 days of adrenalin-pumping activities, healthy local food and spa time.\r\n\r\n<strong>At Inkaterra<\/strong>\r\n\r\nAt Inkaterra Reserva Amaz\u00f3nica, excursions are twice daily. The most hardcore are in the morning (partly due to the 5am wake-up call), taking on knee- knocking canopy walkways, cayman-ridden rivers in a kayak and jungle hikes.\r\n\r\n<strong>Next it&#8217;s on to the Andes<\/strong>\r\n\r\nNext it&#8217;s on to the Andes and Inkaterra Machu Picchu Pueblo Hotel for treks around the everything-it&#8217;s-hyped-up-to-be Lost City of Machu Picchu. After scaling the steps of the 15th-century Inca citadel, it&#8217;s back to Pueblo for daydreaming in the Andean sauna, a candle-lit eucalyptus hut. There are also hot-stone massages with gems and coca-leaf oil (the same leaves that make the class A drug, so it gets the blood flowing).\r\n\r\n<strong>The last stop is Cusco<\/strong>\r\n\r\nThe last stop is Cusco. The UNESCO World Heritage city is 3,400 metres above sea level and Inkaterra La Casona&#8217;s micro-spa is one of the few in the world where therapists ask if you want extra oxygen with your massage. This trip will leave you hyper-toned from trekking, massaged to knot-free oblivion and wide- and bright-eyed having soaked up all the marvels of the Incas.<\/div><!-- .vgblk-rw-wrapper -->","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Say hiking Say hiking and Peru in the same breath and most people think of the Inca Trail.
