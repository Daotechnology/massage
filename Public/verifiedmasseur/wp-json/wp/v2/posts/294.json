They are clean and fresh for each new client, so they always look professional. You can even incorporate headbands into the overall sensory experience of a massage or facial, by adding a few drops of essential oil to gently infuse the air with fragrance and help to create a relaxing or uplifting atmosphere.<\/div><!-- .vgblk-rw-wrapper -->","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Spa has launched a new eco-friendly, single-use headband.
