The phrase no longer refers simply to a lack of illness and disease, but to a more holistic state of being, where mental, physical and emotional health are all in sync.\r\n\r\nJack Ma, Chairman and Founder of Alibaba, says: \u2018Today\u2019s customers want to be healthy and happy, no matter who they are. Owning the most expensive goods has taken a back seat to looking and feeling good, and consumers are showing an increasing preference for participating in activities and indulging in experiences that promote their wellbeing.\u2019\r\n<h2>According to Euromonitor International \r\n\t\t\t.fl-node- h2.vamtam-heading * {<br \/>\r\n\t\t\t\tcolor: #ffa28a !important;<br \/>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t}<br \/>\r\n\t\t<\/h2>\r\n<h3>@SpaNews \r\n\t\t\t.fl-node- h3.vamtam-heading * {<br \/>\r\n\t\t\t\tcolor: #ffa28a !important;<br \/>\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t}<br \/>\r\n\t\t<\/h3>\r\nAccording to Euromonitor International, the global market for health and wellness offerings reached \u00a3535 billion in 2016 and it is expected to grow to \u00a3632 billion by 2021. Weinswig believes wellness is a trend that can only grow; people are increasingly participating in fitness classes and activities that improve wellbeing; frequenting spas and using spa products, eating organic and natural foods, taking health supplements and following special diets.\r\n\r\nMillennials, she states, are driving its growth. Born between 1980 and 1999, they\u2019ve grown up in a time of rapid change, so their priorities are different from previous generations. According to the Harris Group, 72% of millennials would rather purchase experiences than material goods. Wellness is a daily pursuit they\u2019re willing to spend on.\r\n\r\nFor spas wishing to harness this trend, diversification is key. Weinswig highlights changes made at Saks Fifth Avenue New York City flagship store \u2013 a first-of-its-kind retail space dedicated to health, beauty, wellness \u2013 as an example. Called the Wellery, it combines traditional shops with unique in-store experiences; customers can purchase beauty products or luxury workout gear, take fitness classes, get spa treatments such as manicures, facials and makeovers. The store has even introduced a salt room where4 shoppers can schedule a 20-minute \u2018Breathe\u2019 treatment session.\r\n\r\n\u2018Consumers are shifting away from purchasing luxury goods in favour of splurging on wellness as a luxury,\u2019 she says.
